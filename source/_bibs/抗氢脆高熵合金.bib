abstract = {The broad compositional space of high entropy alloys (HEA) is conducive to the design of HEAs with targeted performance. Herein, a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted prediction and optimization strategy is proposed to explore the prototype FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low hydrogen diffusion coefficients. The model for predicting hydrogen solution energies from local HEA chemical environments was constructed via ML algorithms. Based on the inferred correlation between atomic structures and diffusion coefficients of HEAs built using ML models and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we employed the whale optimization algorithm to explore HEA atomic structures with low hydrogen diffusion coefficients. HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients were found to have high Co and Mn content. Finally, a quantitative relationship between the diffusion coefficient and chemical composition is proposed to guide the design of HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients and thus strong resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.}

abstract = {DScribe is a software package for machine learning that provides popular feature transformations (“descriptors”) for atomistic materials simulations. DScribe accelerates the application of machine learning for atomistic property prediction by providing user-friendly, off-the-shelf descriptor implementations. The package currently contains implementations for Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom-centered Symmetry Function (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). Usage of the package is illustrated for two different applications: formation energy prediction for solids and ionic charge prediction for atoms in organic molecules. The package is freely available under the open-source Apache License 2.0.
Program summary
Program Title: DScribe Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/vzrs8n8pk6.1 Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: Python/C/C++ Supplementary material: Supplementary Information as PDF Nature of problem: The application of machine learning for materials science is hindered by the lack of consistent software implementations for feature transformations. These feature transformations, also called descriptors, are a key step in building machine learning models for property prediction in materials science. Solution method: We have developed a library for creating common descriptors used in machine learning applied to materials science. We provide an implementation the following descriptors: Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom-centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). The library has a python interface with computationally intensive routines written in C or C++. The source code, tutorials and documentation are provided online. A continuous integration mechanism is set up to automatically run a series of regression tests and check code coverage when the codebase is updated.}
